The program was designed to use for mineral deposit exploration, ore reserve estimation, mine planning and simulation of processes in mining sites.
The up-to-date goal of the Geoblock project is to create a comprehensive software tools for constructing 3D models of digital terrains, geological structures and mining sites. 
It requires an accomplishment of analysis for land and remote sensing data, surveying, surface and underground modelling, simulation of physical processes and visualisation of spatial objects. 
The project supports a multi language GUI of the program for localization in different countries.
